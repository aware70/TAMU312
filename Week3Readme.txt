+	1. I just used Visual Studio to compile and run this. The file is just a single .cpp with the main and all other functions
+	included. I wasn't sure how I should test all of them so I just executed one (XOR) which you can see in the code. I printed the
+	result and the function count.

+	2. Apologies, this is going to be very sloppy... I've been very busy with work and this sort of snuck up on me especially when I
+	noticed that problem 2 was already due on the 8th. Now, about testing: I heard mention in an email I think of a test rig for 
+	this? Where might I find that?

+	3. Well, it's not complete but I've finally got the harness working which means I can finally test my work. I should be up
+	to date by next week.
